    <!-- QUESTION 2 -->
    <ul><li>How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
    <ul>
        <li>The HTML5 audio and video tags make it simple to add media to a website. You need to set src attribute to identify the media source and <br> include a controls attribute so the user can play and pause the media.</li>
    </ul>
    </li></ul>

    <!-- QUESTION 3 -->
    <ul><li>Semantic element in HTML5? 
        <ul>
            <li>Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as header, <br> footer and article are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.</li>
        </ul>
    </li></ul>


    <!-- question 4 -->
    <ul><li>Canvas and SVG tags 
        <ul>
            <li> <b>SVG</b> The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. <br> Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.</li> <br>
            <li>An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema â€” that means SVG images can be created and edited with any <br> text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.</li> <br>

            <li> <b>Canvas</b> The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. <br> You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images. </li>
